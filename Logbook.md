### 07.02.2024. 
An agreement contract has been established after a long, but positive, discussion. We have decided to use a planning tool called PLANE to help us keep track of each main task and subtask. We have sent an email to our two project mentors regarding the first meeting, expressing our desire for guidance from the mentors. We would like to know which aspects of point cloud technology they are particularly interested in to ensure they can be a strong resource for our project. We have agreed to individual brainstorm ideas for research questions, in case project mentors do not provide any strong interest/guidons on this area.
*Added: We created a Git repository where all files we be uploaded to. We plan to make it public after exam and use it for our individual portfolio.
*Added: We requested access to https://shapenet.org/ where the Dataset is located.

Since our last meeting, one of our project supervisors, Johan Ziruo Ye, has responded and we have agreed on a virtual meeting on Microsoft Teams on 14.02.24 at 15:00. Our request to gain access to [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/) has also been approved. We have agreed to read the three scientific papers provided in the project description ([Paper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233), [Paper 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593), [Paper 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01458)). We discussed them, how they are structured, and how we can draw inspiration from them in forming our own problem formulation, while keeping in mind what we read in the Danish book "Styrk Projektarbejdet" (3rd edition).

We discussed the importance of being very precise in the project description due to the high level of complexity surrounding the subject.

For the meeting, we have prepared some questions:
- The scientific papers use the pronoun "we" every time they describe an action. Would we benefit from using it too, so the end reader will know which steps the project took?
- Is it allowed to use PLANE for the Gantt Cart, the planning tool provides. (Do the supervisors wanted to be invited to the PLANE project?)

Also:
- We hope the supervisor can help us scope the project to the right size.

All members is setup to use the planning tool [PLANE](https://app.plane.so/)

After the meeting with our supervisor we got another research paper on diffusion models. We agreed that we will take a meeting one time per week, and to next time we will read and try to get a good understanding of the theory, models which is used. 

We also agreed that for now our main research question is going to be how to transform the diffusions models used on 2D data in the papers, into a test to see we can bring down the step using the same methods, but using 3D data shapes instead.


### 21.02.2024
Since last week we have read the article given by our supervisor and seen the YouTube video [DDPM - Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis (Machine Learning Research Paper Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-O7AZNzbzQ) and [Diffusion Models | Paper Explanation | Math Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoKDTa5jHvg) and got a "overall" understanding of the subject diffusion models and how they were used in the scientific papers.
Today we are make a draft for the Project Canvas and brainstorming on which research question the project could work with. We agreed with Morten Mørup to sent him our draft to look at it, and we will sent a draft with the research question to Johan Ye to approve our ideas.

### 23.02.2024 

Report draft made for upcoming deadline. 
We sent Morten Mørup our draft
We sent Johan our reseach questions and got a greenlight for 3 of them
