An agreement contract has been established after a long, but positive, discussion. We have decided to use a planning tool called PLANE to help us keep track of each main task and subtask. We have sent an email to our two project mentors regarding the first meeting, expressing our desire for guidance from the mentors. We would like to know which aspects of point cloud technology they are particularly interested in to ensure they can be a strong resource for our project. We have agreed to individual brainstorm ideas for research questions, in case project mentors do not provide any strong interest/guidons on this area.
*Added: We created a Git repository where all files we be uploaded to. We plan to make it public after exam and use it for our individual portfolio.
